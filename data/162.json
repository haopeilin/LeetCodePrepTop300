Thus, we can traverse over the nums array starting from the beginning. Whenever, we find a number nums[i], we only need to check if it is larger than the next number nums[i+1] for determining if nums[i] is the peak element. The reasoning behind this can be understood by taking the following three cases which cover every case into which any problem can be divided.</p>\n<p>Case 1. All the numbers appear in a descending order. In this case, the first element corresponds to the peak element. We start off by checking if the current element is larger than the next one. The first element satisfies this criteria, and is hence identified as the peak correctly. In this case, we didn't reach a point where we needed to compare nums[i] with nums[i−1] also, to determine if it is the peak element or not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2. All the elements appear in ascending order. In this case, we keep on comparing nums[i] with nums[i+1] to determine if nums[i] is the peak element or not. None of the elements satisfy this criteria, indicating that we are currently on a rising slope and not on a peak. Thus, at the end, we need to return the last element as the peak element, which turns out to be correct. In this case also, we need not compare nums[i] with nums[i−1], since being on the rising slope is a sufficient condition to ensure that nums[i] isn't the peak element.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 3. The peak appears somewhere in the middle. In this case, when we are traversing on the rising edge, as in Case 2, none of the elements will satisfy nums[i]&gt;nums[i+1]. We need not compare nums[i] with nums[i−1] on the rising slope as discussed above. When we finally reach the peak element, the condition nums[i]&gt;nums[i+1] is satisfied. We again, need not compare nums[i] with nums[i−1]. This is because, we could reach nums[i] as the current element only when the check nums[i]&gt;nums[i+1] failed for the previous((i−1)th element, indicating that nums[i−1]&lt;nums[i]. Thus, we are able to identify the peak element correctly in this case as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length - 1; i++) {\n            if (nums[i] &gt; nums[i + 1]) {\n                return i;\n            }\n        }\n        return nums.length - 1;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time complexity : O(n).

By making use of this, and the fact that we can return any peak as the result, we can make use of Binary Search to find the required peak element.</p>\n<p>In case of simple Binary Search, we work on a sorted sequence of numbers and try to find out the required number by reducing the search space at every step. In this case, we use a modification of this simple Binary Search to our advantage. We start off by finding the middle element, mid from the given nums array. If this element happens to be lying in a descending sequence of numbers. or a local falling slope(found by comparing nums[i] to its right neighbour), it means that the peak will always lie towards the left of this element. Thus, we reduce the search space to the left of mid(including itself) and perform the same process on left subarray.</p>\n<p>If the middle element, mid lies in an ascending sequence of numbers, or a rising slope(found by comparing nums[i] to its right neighbour), it obviously implies that the peak lies towards the right of this element. Thus, we reduce the search space to the right of mid and perform the same process on the right subarray.</p>\n<p>In this way, we keep on reducing the search space till we eventually reach a state where only one element is remaining in the search space. This single element is the peak element.</p>\n<p>To see how it works, let's consider the three cases discussed above again.</p>\n<p>Case 1. In this case, we firstly find 3 as the middle element. Since it lies on a falling slope, we reduce the search space to <code>[5, 4, 3]</code>. For this subarray, 2 happens to be the middle element, which again lies on a falling slope, reducing the search space to <code>[5, 4]</code>. Now, 1 acts as the middle element and it lies on a falling slope, reducing the search space to <code>[5]</code> only. Thus, 1 is returned as the peak correctly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 2. In this case, we firstly find 3 as the middle element. Since it lies on a rising slope, we reduce the search space to <code>[4, 5]</code>. Now, 4 acts as the middle element for this subarray and it lies on a rising slope, reducing the search space to <code>[5]</code> only. Thus, 5 is returned as the peak correctly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 3. In this case, the peak lies somewhere in the middle. The first middle element is 4. It lies on a rising slope, indicating that the peak lies towards its right. Thus, the search space is reduced to <code>[5, 1]</code>. Now, 5 happens to be the on a falling slope(relative to its right neighbour), reducing the search space to <code>[5]</code> only. Thus, 5 is identified as the peak element correctly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Case 4. In this case, the sequence starts by descending and then ascends later, meaning the valley lies somewhere in the middle. For example, consider <code>[4, 3, 2, 1, 5]</code>. The first middle element is <code>2</code>. It lies on a falling slope (relative to its right neighbor), indicating that the lowest point is to its right. Thus, we reduce the search space to <code>[1, 5]</code>. Now, <code>1</code> lies on a rising slope (relative to its right neighbor), reducing the search space to <code>[5]</code> only. Thus, 5 is identified as the peak element correctly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {\n        return search(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);\n    }\n\n    private int search(int[] nums, int l, int r) {\n        if (l == r) {\n            return l;\n        }\n        int mid = (l + r) / 2;\n        if (nums[mid] &gt; nums[mid + 1]) {\n            return search(nums, l, mid);\n        }\n        return search(nums, mid + 1, r);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time complexity : O(log2​(n)).
