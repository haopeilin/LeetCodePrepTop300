In case we skip one of the peaks (trying to obtain more profit), we will end up losing the profit over one of the transactions leading to an overall lesser profit.</p>\n<p>For example, in the above case, if we skip peaki\u200b and valleyj\u200b trying to obtain more profit by considering points with more difference in heights, the net profit obtained will always be lesser than the one obtained by including them, since C will always be lesser than A+B.</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {\n        int i = 0;\n        int valley = prices[0];\n        int peak = prices[0];\n        int maxprofit = 0;\n        while (i &lt; prices.length - 1) {\n            while (i &lt; prices.length - 1 &amp;&amp; prices[i] &gt;= prices[i + 1]) i++;\n            valley = prices[i];\n            while (i &lt; prices.length - 1 &amp;&amp; prices[i] &lt;= prices[i + 1]) i++;\n            peak = prices[i];\n            maxprofit += peak - valley;\n        }\n        return maxprofit;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time complexity : O(n).

In this case, instead of looking for every peak following a valley, we can simply go on crawling over the slope and keep on adding the profit obtained from every consecutive transaction. In the end,we will be using the peaks and valleys effectively, but we need not track the costs corresponding to the peaks and valleys along with the maximum profit, but we can directly keep on adding the difference between the consecutive numbers of the array if the second number is larger than the first one, and at the total sum we obtain will be the maximum profit. This approach will simplify the solution.<br/>\nThis can be made clearer by taking this example:</p>\n<p>[1,\u200b7,\u200b2,\u200b3,\u200b6,\u200b7,\u200b6,\u200b7\u200b]</p>\n<p>The graph corresponding to this array is:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From the above graph, we can observe that the sum A+B+C is equal to the difference D corresponding to the difference between the heights of the consecutive peak and valley.</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {\n        int maxprofit = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt; prices.length; i++) {\n            if (prices[i] &gt; prices[i - 1])\n                maxprofit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];\n        }\n        return maxprofit;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time complexity : O(n).
