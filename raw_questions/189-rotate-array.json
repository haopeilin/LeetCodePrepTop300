        "The easiest solution would use additional memory and that is perfectly fine.",
        "The actual trick comes when trying to solve this problem without using any additional memory. This means you need to use the original array somehow to move the elements around. Now, we can place each element in its original location and shift all the elements around it to adjust as that would be too costly and most likely will time out on larger input arrays.",
        "One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example.",
        "The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable. We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on <b>cyclic-dependencies</b> between elements."

Another array of the same size is used.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h3><a href=\"#approach-3-using-cyclic-replacements\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Approach 3: Using Cyclic Replacements</h3>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>\n<p>We can directly place every number of the array at its required correct position.<br/>\nBut if we do that, we will destroy the original element. Thus, we need to store<br/>\nthe number being replaced in a temp variable. Then, we can place the replaced<br/>\nnumber(temp) at its correct position and so on, n times, where n is<br/>\nthe length of array. We have chosen n to be the number of replacements since we have<br/>\nto shift all the elements of the array(which is n).<br/>\nBut, there could be a problem with this method, if n%k=0<br/>\nwhere k=k%n (since a value of k larger than n eventually<br/>\nleads to a k equivalent to k%n).<br/>\nIn this case, while picking up numbers to be placed at the<br/>\ncorrect position, we will eventually reach the number from<br/>\nwhich we originally started. Thus, in such a case, when<br/>\nwe hit the original number's index again, we start the same process<br/>\nwith the number following it.</p>\n<p>Now let's look at the proof of how the above method works.<br/>\nSuppose, we have n as the number of elements in the array and<br/>\nk is the number of shifts required. Further, assume n%k=0.<br/>\nNow, when we start placing the elements at their correct position,<br/>\nin the first cycle all the numbers with their index i satisfying<br/>\ni%k=0 get placed at their required position.<br/>\nThis happens because when we jump k steps every time,<br/>\nwe will only hit the numbers k steps apart.<br/>\nWe start with index i=0, having i%k=0.<br/>\nThus, we hit all the numbers satisfying the above condition in the first cycle.<br/>\nWhen we reach back the original index, we have placed kn\u200b<br/>\nelements at their correct position,<br/>\nsince we hit only that many elements in the first cycle.<br/>\nNow, we increment the index for replacing the numbers.<br/>\nThis time, we place other kn\u200b elements at their correct position,<br/>\ndifferent from the ones placed correctly in the first cycle,<br/>\nbecause this time we hit all the numbers satisfy the condition i%k=1.<br/>\nWhen we hit the starting number again,<br/>\nwe increment the index and repeat the same process from i=1<br/>\nfor all the indices satisfying i%k==1.<br/>\nThis happens till we reach the number with the index i%k=0<br/>\nagain, which occurs for i=k.<br/>\nWe will reach such a number after a total of k cycles.<br/>\nNow, the total count of numbers exclusive numbers placed at their correct<br/>\nposition will be k\u00d7kn\u200b=n.<br/>\nThus, all the numbers will be placed at their correct position.</p>\n<p>Look at the following example to clarify the process:</p>\n<pre><code>int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};\nint k = 2;</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time complexity: O(n). Only one pass is used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Space complexity: O(1). Constant extra space is used.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h3><a href=\"#approach-4-using-reverse\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Approach 4: Using Reverse</h3>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>\n<p>This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times, k elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest of the elements from the front shift backwards.</p>\n<p>In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest n\u2212k elements gives us the required result.</p>\n<p>Let n=7 and k=3.</p>\n<pre><code>int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};\n// Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n// After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n// After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1\n// After reversing last n-k numbers: 5 6 7 1 2 3 4  // Result</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n\n<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time complexity: O(n). n elements are reversed a total of three times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>",
