Approach 1 is a brute-force, and then Approaches 2 to 4 build on each other, and Approach 5 is similar, but approaches the thinking from a very different angle. If you only want to study the first 2 approaches, then that's fine. Approach 2 should be sufficient for an interview. However, we hope you enjoy learning about this question enough that you'll keep reading! :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you read the question carefully</strong></p>\n<p>This question was designed with fixed-sized integers in mind. Some languages, such as Python and JavaScript, only have arbitrary-precision integers (meaning they can go <em>huge</em>, probably as big as you'll ever need!). Depending on which programming languages you're familiar with, the requirements of this question might seem a little tedious and silly to you. We recommend using a language such as C, C++, or Java for it if you're familiar with them. Otherwise, you'll just need to be really careful and think very carefully about whether or not your algorithm would work in a 32-bit-signed-integer environment. Unfortunately, Leetcode doesn't currently enforce these requirements in languages such as Python, so it's up to you to determine whether or not your solution really is a \"correct\" one. Hint: Throw heaps of <code>assert</code> statements into your code.</p>\n<p>Most of the upvoted posts on the discussion forum <em>aren't following the rules specified in the question</em>. Here are some of the problems I've seen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The use of <code>long</code> in Java or <code>long long</code> in C++ is <em>not allowed</em>, because the question states that we're working in an environment where we only have integers within the range [\u2212231,231\u22121].</li>\n<li>The use of <code>abs</code> in Python (and other arbitrary-precision integer languages) needs to be considered carefully, because abs(\u2212231)=231, <em>which is <strong>outside</strong> the allowed range by 1</em>.</li>\n<li>While you might be tempted to use multiplication and division for a few \"simple\" tasks, this is unnecessary. Here are some alternatives:\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of <code>a = a * -1</code> for making numbers negative, use <code>a = -a</code>.</li>\n<li>Instead of using <code>a / 2</code> for dividing by <code>2</code>, use the right shift operator; <code>a &gt;&gt; 1</code>.</li>\n<li>Instead of using <code>a * 2</code> for doubling, use <code>a = a + a</code>, <code>a += a</code>, or even the left shift operator; <code>a &lt;&lt; 1</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, we strongly advise against allowing overflows to happen <em>at all</em>. For some compilers/interpreters/languages, <code>INT_MAX + 1 \u2261 INT_MIN</code>. For others, <code>INT_MAX + 1 \u2261 INT_MAX</code>. And for others again, it is <code>undefined</code> or <em><strong>crash</strong></em>. Some people on the discussion forum have written code that actually relies on specific overflow behaviour for correctness. While this can be quite \"clever\", it's not portable at all. For code like that to be shippable, you'd need to be <em>certain</em> of the behaviour of the specific system it is to run on, and that no future system upgrade would change the behaviour. If it works on your machine, but not on Leetcode's machine, it's <em>incorrect code</em>.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll be looking at a few techniques that can solve the problem elegantly and are portable.</p>\n<p><strong>In what cases will the <em>final result</em> be out of range?</strong></p>\n<p>We're told the following about overflow in the problem description:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231\u22121 when the division result overflows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, keeping in mind that our integer range is [\u2212231,231\u22121], in what cases could we have an end result <em>outside</em> of this range?</p>\n<p>Well, when we do <code>a / b = c</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both <em>positive integers</em>, we know that <code>c \u2264 a</code>. In other words, the answer (<code>c</code>) cannot end up bigger than the thing we divided (the dividend, <code>a</code>).</p>\n<p>Something similar happens even when one or both of them are negative. In that case, <code>abs(a) \u2264 abs(c)</code>. Another way of thinking about it is that <code>c</code> will <em>always</em> be closer to zero than <code>a</code> is (or, they could also be equal).</p>\n<p>Therefore, for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> within the range [\u2212231+1,231\u22121], the result <code>a / b</code> will be closer to zero, so has to be fine.</p>\n<p>However, notice we left \u2212231 out of the above range. This is because there's a special case of \u2212231/\u22121, which has an answer of 231. But 231 is outside of the integer range! So instead we return 231\u22121 for this case (which is in range).</p>\n<p>Most algorithms for this question simply check for the case \u2212231/\u22121 at the start, returning 231\u22121 if they detect it. This is a sensible approach.</p>\n<br/>\n<hr/>\n<h3><a href=\"#approach-1-repeated-subtraction\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Approach 1: Repeated Subtraction</h3>\n<p><strong>Intuition</strong></p>\n<p><em>This approach won't pass the large test cases. However, we'll use it as a starting point, and to introduce a key idea we'll be using for all the approaches\u2014doing <strong>all</strong> intermediate working with negative numbers.</em></p>\n<p>Think about what it means to divide two integers. In order to divide, say, <code>15</code> by <code>5</code>, we ask how many times we can put <code>5</code> into <code>15</code>. The simplest way of doing this is to subtract <code>5</code> from <code>15</code> repeatedly until we can no longer do so.</p>\n<pre><code>15 - 5 = 10\n10 - 5 = 5\n 5 - 5  = 0</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>Because we were able to do <code>3</code> subtractions, we know the answer to <code>15 / 5</code> is <code>3</code>.</p>\n<p>As another example, consider dividing <code>20</code> by <code>3</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>20 - 3 = 17\n17 - 3 = 14\n14 - 3 = 11\n11 - 3 = 8\n 8 - 3 = 5\n 5 - 3 = 2</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>We had to stop when we got to <code>2</code>, because <code>3</code> is bigger than <code>2</code>. So, because we were able to do <code>6</code> subtractions, we know the answer to <code>20 / 3</code> is <code>6</code>.</p>\n<p>In the example above, we call <code>20</code> the <code>dividend</code> and <code>3</code> the <code>divisor</code> (<code>2</code> is the <em>remainder</em>, which we ignore for this question). The result of dividing the <code>dividend</code> by the <code>divisor</code> is the number of times we could subtract the <code>divisor</code> from the <code>dividend</code>. A commonly used name for this result is the <code>quotient</code>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, our first algorithm will simply subtract the <code>divisor</code> from the <code>dividend</code> repeatedly until doing so would push it below <code>0</code>. It will keep count of the number of these subtractions done, so that it can return it at the end.</p>\n<p><em>Assuming that both the dividend and divisor are positive</em>, here is a code snippet for this process.</p>\n<pre><code>public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n    int quotient = 0;\n    while (dividend - divisor &gt;= 0) {\n        quotient++;\n        dividend -= divisor;\n    }\n    return quotient;\n}</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>This doesn't work if one, or both, of the <code>dividend</code> or <code>divisor</code> are negative\u2014the dividend will head <em>away</em> from zero! Trying to generalise this code to handle all four of the possible sign combinations is problematic, because some are repeated addition instead of subtraction, and some have a <code>&lt;= 0</code> continuation case instead of <code>&gt;= 0</code>.</p>\n<p>A logical solution here is to simply convert any negative inputs to positives, and then put a negative sign back on at the end if needed. Recall that <code>positive * negative = negative</code>, and <code>negative * negative = positive</code>. In other words, if there was exactly one negative sign in the inputs, the final result is negative. Otherwise, it's positive.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code> 60 /  10 =  6\n-60 /  10 = -6\n 60 / -10 = -6\n-60 / -10 =  6</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>We'll avoid using <code>abs</code> (it causes overflows, that we'll talk more about soon). So for now, let's just use some conditionals so that we can count the negative signs at the same time as making the numbers positive. At the end, we'll then need to put the sign back on if needed.</p>\n<pre><code>public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n    // Count the number of negatives + convert parameters to positives.\n    int negatives = 0;\n    if (dividend &lt; 0) {\n        negatives++;\n        dividend = -dividend;\n    }\n    if (divisor &lt; 0) {\n        negatives++;\n        divisor = -divisor;\n    }\n\n    // Count the number of subtractions.\n    int subtractions = 0;\n    while (dividend - divisor &gt;= 0) {\n        subtractions++;\n        dividend -= divisor;\n    }\n\n    // Convert back to negative if needed.\n    if (negatives == 1) {\n        subtractions = -subtractions;\n    }\n\n    return subtractions;\n}</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>However, there are still a couple of issues here.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we haven't handled the <code>-2147483648 / -1</code> case. Like we said in the Overview section, this case is best handled as a special case at the start of the algorithm.</p>\n<pre><code>if (dividend == -2147483648 &amp;&amp; divisor == -1) {\n    return 2147483647;\n}</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>The second issue doesn't happen in Java, but it will happen with the same algorithm in <code>C</code>\u2014an integer overflow. In Java, the math happens to combine perfectly with Java's overflow behaviour to give the correct answers. Because our goal for this solution article is to develop portable algorithms that work with any compiler/interpreter/language, we still want to fix this (and will need this same idea for our other approaches anyway). Specifically, the potentially problematic code is on these lines:</p>\n<pre><code>dividend = -dividend;</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>divisor = -divisor;</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>If <code>dividend = -2147483648</code>, then converting it to a positive number will behave differently depending on the language/compiler/interpreter you're using. This is because the positive form (<code>2147483648</code>) is outside of the 32-bit signed integer range.</p>\n<p>Treating this as an edge case is impractical\u2014it affects billions of cases. We'll need a better way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key observation to make is that the problems are occurring because there are more negative signed 32-bit integers than there are positive signed 32-bit integers. Each positive signed 32-bit integer has a corresponding negative signed 32-bit integer. However, the same is not true for negative signed 32-bit integers. The smallest one, <code>-2147483648</code>, is alone. It is this number that causes the problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best solution is to work with negative, instead of positive, numbers. This is allows us to use the largest possible range of numbers, and it covers all the ones we need.</p>\n<p>At the start of the algorithm, we'll instead convert both inputs to <em>negative</em>. Then, we'll need to modify the loop so that it <em>subtracts</em> the negative divisor from the negative dividend. At the end, we'll need to convert the result back to a positive if the number of negative signs in the input was not 1.</p>\n<p>The code for this is our complete approach 1, and can be found in the code box below.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that we're converting the inputs to <em>negative</em> numbers. This is because we don't want separate code for all the possible combinations of positive/negative divisor and dividend. We converted them to negative instead of positive because the range of valid negative numbers is bigger, and therefore overflows can be cleanly avoided.</p>\n<p>The looping condition is <code>while (dividend - divisor &lt;= 0)</code> because the difference is moving towards zero from the <em>negative</em> side. Therefore, we want to continue while it is still under it. Once it goes over, we know we're done.</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\npublic:\n \u00a0 \u00a0int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0// Special case: overflow.\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (dividend == INT_MIN &amp;&amp; divisor == -1) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0return INT_MAX;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n\u200b\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/* We need to convert both numbers to negatives\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * for the reasons explained above.\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * Also, we count the number of negatives signs. */\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0int negatives = 2;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (dividend &gt; 0) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0negatives--;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0dividend = -dividend;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (divisor &gt; 0) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0negatives--;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0divisor = -divisor;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n\u200b\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/* Count how many times the divisor has to be added\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * to get the dividend.

A better way would be to try and subtract multiple copies of the divisor each time.</p>\n<p>One way of quickly increasing numbers, without using multiplication, is to double them repeatedly. So let's try doubling the divisor until it no longer fits into the dividend.</p>\n<p>It'll be easiest to understand with an example, so let's say we have a dividend of <code>93706</code> and a divisor of <code>157</code>. We'll now just see what happens when we repeatedly double <code>157</code> until it's bigger than <code>93706</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>157\n314\n628\n1256\n2512\n5024\n10048\n20096\n40192\n80384\n160768 # Too big</code></pre><svg><path></path></svg>\n<p>From this, we know that we can fit <code>80384</code> into <code>93706</code>, and that <code>80384</code> must be a multiple of <code>157</code>. But how many copies of <code>157</code> is this?</p>\n<p>Well, each time we double a number we also double the amount of copies of the original number. So because we doubled <code>157</code> nine times, we must have had <code>2\u2079</code> copies of <code>157</code>. Indeed, <code>2\u2079 \u00b7 157 = 80384</code>. Yay!</p>\n<p>But, we still have some left over\u2014in fact we have <code>93706 - 80384 = 13322</code> left over! That's still a <em>lot</em> of copies of <code>157</code> we haven't counted! So what could we do about this? Well, if we work out how many times <code>157</code> fits into <code>13322</code>, we could just add that to <code>512</code> to get our result.</p>\n<p>How can we work out how many times <code>157</code> fits into <code>13322</code>? Well, we just repeat the same process, adding to the result as we go, until there's nothing left for <code>157</code> to fit into.</p>\n<p>If we do this, we'll find that <code>157 \u00b7 2\u2076 = 10048</code> is the highest power that fits into <code>13322</code>, leaving us with <code>13322 - 10048 = 3274</code> and a quotient so far of <code>2\u2076 + 2\u2079 = 576</code> (if you noticed that <code>10048</code> looks very familiar, well done. We'll be looking at this in approach 3).</p>\n<p>We repeat this process until the dividend is less than <code>157</code>.</p>\n<p>Here is the algorithm in code (for this example we're pretending the numbers are positive, and we're ignoring the \"overflow\" case. In the actual code, we use negatives numbers to prevent the overflow).</p>\n<pre><code>int quotient = 0;\n/* Once the divisor is bigger than the current dividend,\n * we can't fit any more copies of the divisor into it. */\nwhile (dividend &gt;= divisor) {\n    /* Now that we're in the loop, we know it'll fit at least once as\n     * divivend &gt;= divisor */\n    int powerOfTwo = 1;\n    int value = divisor;\n    /* Check if double the current value is too big.

It it a lot like binary search, having the same time complexity of O(logn).

We provide this approach as an alternate way of thinking about the problem, that some people might relate better to.</p>\n<p>Anyway, another way we could divide two integers is to consider how we do division in math.</p>\n<p>One of the common ways, which you may or may not have learned in school, is called long division.</p>\n<p>Like the previous two approaches, long division works by find a large multiple of the divisor which fits into the dividend. Then it subtracts this from the dividend and repeats the process.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Long Division in Base-10</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>If you're familiar with long division feel free to skip this next bit.</em></p>\n<p>Let's go through an example of long division. We'll start with a divisor of <code>379</code> and dividend of <code>872703948</code>. To perform division, we go through each digit looking at whether or not <code>379</code> fits into the right-most digits we've looked at so far.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the first digit:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Clearly <code>379</code> does not fit into <code>8</code>, so we put a <code>0</code> and continue to the next digit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Same thing again, <code>379</code> doesn't fit into <code>87</code>, so we put a <code>0</code> and continue to the next digit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally we find <code>379</code> <em>does</em> fit into <code>872</code> (because <code>379</code> \u2264 <code>872</code>, it must fit in). Because it fits in two times we put the digit <code>2</code> onto our result. Don't worry about the multiplication we just referred to, we have a solution for that shortly!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At this point, you might wonder why we divide to see how many times <code>379</code> goes into <code>872</code>. This is because what it actually means is how many times <code>379000000</code> goes into <code>872703948</code>. It goes in <code>2</code> times. Okay, let's continue on.</p>\n<p>However <code>379000000</code> doesn't go into <code>872703948</code> exactly <code>2</code> times; <code>379000000 * 2 = 758000000</code>.</p>\n<p><code>758000000</code> is quite a bit short of <code>872703948</code>. In fact, there's still <code>872703948 - 758000000 = 114703948</code> left over.</p>\n<p>We now need to find how many times <code>379</code> goes into <code>114703948</code>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now we simply repeat the process again with the difference. Let's start with the first digit again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like before, <code>379</code> doesn't fit into <code>1</code>. Repeating this again, we'll see that it doesn't go into <code>11</code> or <code>114</code> either. In fact, it's impossible for it to fit until the digit after the one where we placed our <code>2</code>. This shouldn't be too surprising\u2014if it did fit into the first three digits, we should've had a <code>3</code> (or higher) instead of a <code>2</code>.</p>\n<p>As such, we can simply continue the process from the digit position after the <code>2</code>. Doing so, we discover that <code>379</code> goes into <code>1147</code> a total of <code>3</code> times. Let's add that to our result.</p>\n<p>(Remember this means <code>37900000</code> goes into <code>114703948</code> at most <code>3</code> times).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We continue to repeat this process. Eventually, we'll run out of digits and wind up with our final result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With this final result, we now know that <code>379</code> goes into <code>114703948</code> a total of <code>2302648</code> times.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Long Division in Base-2</strong></em></p>\n<p>One of the problems with using base-10 division for this problem is that in order to perform the algorithm, we'd need to be able to add the necessary <code>0</code>s onto the end of the divisor. Given that we aren't allowed to use multiplication, this would prove to be a bit of a challenge!</p>\n<p>Additionally, the current divisor could fit into the current dividend up to <code>10</code> times. Again, without multiplication, this is a bit annoying to calculate.</p>\n<p>There are ways we can hack around these problems, but a far better way is to simply do the division in base-2 so that we can use bitwise operators.</p>\n<p>In base-2, division works exactly the same way. However, because there are only two digits (<code>1</code> and <code>0</code>), we can simply check if the divisor-padded-with-zeroes is greater than the current dividend, and then if it is, add a <code>0</code> digit to the quotient, otherwise add a <code>1</code> digit.</p>\n<p>Here's an animation showing base-2 long division.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>\n<p>Like other approaches we use negative numbers so that the maximum possible range of numbers is available to us.</p>\n<p>We can no longer assume the divisor, that we're right shifting, is always an <em>even</em> number. Therefore, we need to add 1 before doing the right shift. Otherwise, it could be off by 1: <code>(divisor + 1) &gt;&gt; 1;</code>.</p>\n<p>Not all programming languages support <em>left</em> shifting with negative numbers. In those that do, we need to be really careful with overflows.</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\nprivate:\n \u00a0 \u00a0int HALF_INT_MIN = -1073741824;\n\u200b\npublic:\n \u00a0 \u00a0int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0// Special cases: overflow.\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (dividend == INT_MIN &amp;&amp; divisor == -1) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0return INT_MAX;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (dividend == INT_MIN &amp;&amp; divisor == 1) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0return INT_MIN;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n\u200b\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/* We need to convert both numbers to negatives.\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * Also, we count the number of negatives signs. */\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0int negatives = 2;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (dividend &gt; 0) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0negatives--;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0dividend = -dividend;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0if (divisor &gt; 0) {\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0negatives--;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0divisor = -divisor;\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  }\n\u200b\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/* We want to find the largest doubling of the divisor in the negative\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * 32-bit integer range that could fit into the dividend.
